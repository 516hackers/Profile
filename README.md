```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Free User] --> B[Buys Tokens]
    B --> C{Chooses Referrer?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Joins Under Referrer]
    C -->|No| E[Auto-joins Company]
    D --> F[Referrer Gets 8% Bonus]
    E --> G[Company Account]
```

**Example:**
- User A (free) → Buys tokens → Chooses User B as referrer
- User B receives 8% direct bonus on User A's activation

## 💰 Direct Bonus (8%)

### Calculation Formula
**Direct Bonus = Joining Amount × 8%**

### Practical Example
